# ANZ-Forage-Cybersecurity-Project
Completed a cybersecurity management simulation with ANZ Australia through Forage. Focused on identifying cybersecurity threats, investigating suspicious emails, and analyzing a Packet Capture (PCAP) file using Wireshark to detect and assess potential threats.

# ANZ Australia Cyber Security Management Simulation

As part of this simulation, I completed two key tasks that demonstrate my cybersecurity skills:

## Task 1: Email Investigation
I analyzed several emails to identify whether they were safe or malicious. This involved examining sender addresses, links, and content for phishing tactics, such as suspicious domains, social engineering, and unprofessional formatting. For example, I identified a phishing email using a deceptive URL ("face√üook") intended to steal login credentials.

## Task 2: Packet Capture (PCAP) File Analysis
Using Wireshark, I analyzed network traffic to extract various files, including images and documents. I identified hidden messages in image files by investigating TCP streams and decoded suspicious files using HEX and base64 decoding methods. One key finding was a hidden message embedded in a downloaded document that revealed potential malicious activity.
